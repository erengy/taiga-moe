This feature requires using the Discord desktop client (i.e. it won't work if you open Discord in a regular web browser).

*Display current activity as a status message* option at Discord desktop client's *Activity Settings → Activity Privacy* must be enabled. But do not add Taiga as a game, or it will show up when you're not watching anything.

In Taiga, make sure you have *Tools → Enable auto sharing* and *Settings → Sharing → Discord → Update rich presence* options enabled.

Note that the delay time at *Settings → Recognition* affects automatic sharing too.

Rich presence updates may take an additional 15 seconds to appear, due to Discord's rate limit.
