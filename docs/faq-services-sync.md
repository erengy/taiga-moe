It's very difficult to get this right. Building a map of all anime between services, handling inconsistencies and keeping things up-to-date requires a great deal of development time and additional human effort. It'd be great to have this feature in Taiga, and we've given a lot of thought into it. However, it's not a feasible feature to work on at the moment.

Note that Kitsu is able to automatically sync your library updates to MyAnimeList. Visit the [*Settings → Export*](https://kitsu.io/settings/exports) page to set it up.
